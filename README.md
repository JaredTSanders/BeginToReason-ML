# Research on Machine Learning

This is the first real code in the attempt to use machine learning, specifically Google's TensorFlow, to predict a student's future performance in the course, based on an online utility called **BeginToReason**. If you want to try it out, you can visit it [here](https://resolve.cs.clemson.edu/beginToReason/section1dry).

> **Note:**  **BeginToReason** is a NSF funded grant project that has been developed in order to provide a learning tool for entry level computer science students. This was developed by Clemson University, Florida Atlantic University, Indiana University Southeast. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/ClemsonRSRG/beginToReason) on github.

# Goal
The goal of this project, as stated, is to take a number of factors, beginning with a student's results from the BeginToReason utility, and attempt to predict how they will do further along the course. This will be used to attempt to identify students who may need further help or guidance on certain subjects, or overall.

# Progress
This is still a work in progress. The predictions that are currently outputted are speculative at best, although they are improving with each training run. Should you like to view the sample data, you can do so at the links contained in the load_data.py. This will be changing quite frequently in the coming weeks, and will hopefully be close to what we're looking for by Summer of this year.
